<?php

function foo() {
    $a[] = 'a';
    echo $a[0];
    
    $b = $c[0];
}

Line 4: ``$a`` was never initialized. Although not strictly required by PHP, it is generally a good practice to add ``$a = array();`` before regardless.
Line 7: The variable ``$c`` does not exist. Did you forget to declare it?
